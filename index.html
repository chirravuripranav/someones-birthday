        <p class="reveal-text">I hope today feels gentle on you — like a quiet morning breeze, like a pause where everything heavy steps aside for a moment. I hope you allow yourself to smile, to feel proud of the person you are becoming.</p>
        <p class="reveal-text">You carry a rare balance — softness that listens and strength that endures. The kind that doesn’t ask for attention, yet leaves a lasting calm wherever it goes. I hope life protects that part of you.</p>
        <p class="reveal-text">As another year opens in front of you, I wish you days filled with clarity, nights filled with peace, and dreams that feel less like pressure and more like quiet hope. May your efforts be rewarded, your struggles softened, and your heart guided toward places that feel safe and meaningful.</p>
        <p class="reveal-text">Wherever life takes you, I wish for your happiness in the truest sense — Take care of yourself, today and always.....</p>

      <p>It was late at night. The bus moved quietly through empty roads, its lights cutting through the darkness. She sat by the window, earphones in, watching the world slide past her eyes. There were only a few people in the bus, far away from her — everyone lost in their own silence. She looked tired. At 11:54 PM, the bus slowed.</p>
      <img src="images/story/panel02.png" loading="lazy">
    </div>
    <div class="story-block">
      <p>She stood up calmly, held her bag, and stepped down onto the road. The bus left. And suddenly, everything felt quieter. The night air was cool against her skin. The streetlights cast a soft glow on the wet pavement. She began to walk.</p>
      <img src="images/story/panel05.png" loading="lazy">
    </div>
    <div class="story-block">
      <p>she noticed it. A soft pink glow on the road ahead. She stopped. At first, she thought it was just light playing tricks on her tired eyes. But the glow didn’t disappear. She walked closer… knelt down… and reached out. In her hand lay a small, glowing pink diamond — warm, gentle, alive.</p>
      <img src="images/story/panel11.png" loading="lazy">
      <img src="images/story/panel12.png" style="margin-top:20px;" loading="lazy">
    </div>
    <div class="story-block">
      <p>And then, quietly, it changed. The diamond unfolded into a pink butterfly, glowing softly against the night. It fluttered up and rested gently on her nose. For the first time that night, she smiled. The butterfly lifted off and flew toward the trees nearby. She watched it circle once… then again — as if asking her to come along. She hesitated.</p>
      <img src="images/story/panel16.png" loading="lazy">
    </div>
    <div class="story-block">
      <p>But something inside her said it was okay. So she followed. The path grew darker. The sounds of the night grew louder. Trees surrounded her, and the familiar road was gone. Fear crept in. She sat down on the ground, unsure, overwhelmed. That’s when the butterfly returned. It circled her gently — not rushing her — just reminding her she wasn’t alone. She stood up. And trusted it. As she walked forward, the darkness slowly filled with light. One butterfly became many. Then dozens. Then hundreds. Pink glowing butterflies filled the air, dancing softly around her.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="story-block">
      <p>Ahead, they gathered around something glowing brightly. She reached out… And when she touched it — The world changed. Greenery bloomed around her. Waterfalls flowed softly. The air felt warm, calm, safe. Bells rang gently in the distance. The sky shifted. It was 12:00 AM. January 28th.</p>

    <div class="story-block">
      <p>Lotus petals began to fall from above. And in the sky, written softly among the clouds, were the words: Happy Birthday. In front of her stood a small table. A cake. A letter. Animals gathered peacefully. She lit the candle. Closed her eyes. And smiled.</p>

      <img src="images/story/panel43.png" style="margin-top:20px;" loading="lazy">
    </div>
    <div class="story-block">
      <p>She opened the letter. It read: Happy Birthday to you. May peace and happiness find you again and again, just like these pink glowing butterflies. — someone. She laughed softly... suddenly she opened her eyes, she was in home actually, the time was exactly 12 am, 28th january of 2026. Her taste buds were still tingling with the same taste of the cake from her dream. She saw a real cake with a note on it, same as the one in her dream.</p>

    <p class="moon-text">On this day, the moon rested in its waxing gibbous phase — a moment of becoming, where light is patiently growing, even if it isn’t complete yet. It reminds us that beauty exists not only in fullness, but in progress, in the quiet effort of moving forward. The moon doesn’t rush its journey, and still, it never fails to shine.

May your life follow that same gentle rhythm — growing at your own pace, finding light even during uncertain phases, and trusting that every step, no matter how small, is shaping something meaningful. May you always remember that you don’t have to be perfect or finished to be radiant. Sometimes, simply becoming is enough</p>
